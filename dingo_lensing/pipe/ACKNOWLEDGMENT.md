This module is closely based on the lscsoft [`bilby_pipe`](https://git.ligo.org/lscsoft/bilby_pipe)  and [`dingo`](https://github.com/dingo-gw/dingo)package, which is licensed under the MIT License. It reuses code from `bilby_pipe` and inherits from `bilby_pipe` classes, with suitable modifications to work with Dingo and Bilby.
